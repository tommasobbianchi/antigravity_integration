# Antigravity Integration Todo

## Logic
- [ ] Add support for streaming responses in `client.py`?
- [ ] Implement "Context Awareness" (zipping project files to send to agent).
- [ ] Improve error handling for timeouts (currently 300s fixed).

## Testing
- [ ] Add integration tests against a live relay.
- [ ] Mock the `/api/status` endpoint in tests.

## Deployment
- [ ] Script to auto-pull updates on spokes?
